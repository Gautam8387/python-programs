# Weighted Feature scoring
## Objective
Develop a Python program that ranks features for each group in a large graph dataset, considering both feature abundance and group similarities. The program should assign higher scores to features that are prominent in closely related groups (e.g., those sharing many edges) compared to features prominent in unrelated groups. Implement this analysis using out-of-core computation techniques to handle a diskbacked feature matrix that's too large to fit in memory.
## Given:
1. An undirected graph G(V, E) with |V| = n nodes in CSR (Compressed Sparse Row) matrix format.
2. Edge weights w(e) ∈ [0, 1] for all e ∈ E.
3. A partition P of V into g groups: P = {P₁, P₂, ..., Pg}, where g ≥ 2 and |Pᵢ| ≠ |Pⱼ| for some i ≠ j.
4. A feature matrix M ∈ ℝⁿˣᶠ stored in a disk-backed format (e.g., Zarr), where some elements may be zero, but ∀i, Σⱼ Mᵢⱼ ≠ 0 and ∀j, Σᵢ Mᵢⱼ ≠ 0.
## Important Note:
The feature matrix M is too large to fit entirely in memory. All operations on M must be performed using out-of-core computation techniques.
## Task:
Implement a solution that identifies the most specific and abundant features for each group, considering the relationships between groups, while working with the disk-backed matrix storage.
## Implementation Requirements:
### 1. Data Loading:
- Use Zarr or a similar disk-backed storage system to read the feature matrix M.
- Implement chunked reading to process the matrix in manageable portions.
### 2. Score Calculation:
Adapt the provided score calculation method to work with chunked data:
```python
def calculate_scores(matrix, groups, chunk_size):
    total_ranks = None
    for chunk in matrix.iter_chunks(chunk_size):
        chunk_ranks = chunk.rank(method="dense")
        if total_ranks is None:
            total_ranks = chunk_ranks.groupby(groups).sum()
        else:
            total_ranks += chunk_ranks.groupby(groups).sum()
    mean_ranks = total_ranks / len(matrix)
    score = mean_ranks.reindex(set(groups))
    return score / score.sum()
```
### 3. Graph Relationship Analysis:
Implement the graph analysis components as before, ensuring that any large data structures are also handled in a memory-efficient manner.
### 4. Adjusted Scoring:
Modify the adjusted scoring method to work with the chunked score calculation:
```python
def adjusted_scoring(scores, sim_matrix):
    # Implement the adjustment based on group similarities
    # Ensure this function can handle scores calculated from chunks
    pass
```
### 5. Feature Ranking:
Perform the final ranking of features for each group based on the adjusted scores.
## Additional Considerations:
**1. Memory Management**:
- Monitor and limit memory usage throughout the process.
- Use generators or iterators where possible to avoid loading large data structures into memory.

**2. Parallelization**:
- Consider implementing parallel processing for chunk operations to improve performance.

**3. I/O Optimization:**
- Minimize disk I/O by optimizing the chunk size and reading patterns.

**4. Scalability Testing:**
- Provide a method to test the solution on progressively larger datasets to demonstrate scalability.

## Output:
The output requirements remain the same as in the previous version but with an added emphasis on performance metrics:
1. Ranked list of features for each group.
2. Adjusted scores for each feature.
3. Explanation of group relationship influences.
4. Performance metrics:
    - Total runtime
    - Peak memory usage
    - I/O statistics (e.g., total data read, number of read operations)
